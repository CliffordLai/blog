Source code for my [Consuming and Publishing Celery Tasks in C++ via AMQP](https://blog.petrzemek.net/2017/06/25/consuming-and-publishing-celery-tasks-in-cpp-via-amqp/) English blog post.

The code is divided into two parts: [C++](https://github.com/s3rvac/blog/tree/master/en-2017-06-25-consuming-and-publishing-celery-tasks-in-cpp-via-amqp/cpp) and [Python](https://github.com/s3rvac/blog/tree/master/en-2017-06-25-consuming-and-publishing-celery-tasks-in-cpp-via-amqp/python).
